*vimchant.txt*          Vimchant - spell-checker plugin             2008-08-13


Description     Vimchant is a simple but efficient spell-checker plugin. It's 
                not bundled with many features but it provides fast real-time 
                spell-checking while typing and editing text. Vimchant uses 
                Enchant as its back-end program. Enchant, in turn, is 
                a front-end for several different spell-checkers, including 
                Ispell, Aspell and Voikko. This plugin does not provide 
                Enchant itself; it's a separate component included in modern 
                GNU/Linux systems.

COMMANDS AND CONFIGURATION                            *:VimchantSpellCheckOn*
                                                      *:VimchantSpellCheckOff*

The spell-checker can be turned on and off for current buffer with the 
following ex commands:

        :VimchantSpellCheckOn
        :VimchantSpellCheckOff

Alternatively, there's a short-cut key for quick switching:

        <Leader>ss              Turn the spell-checker on/off

It works in Vim's normal mode. By default <Leader> is the backslash key (\ss) 
but it can be configured with g:mapleader variable. The short-cut key may not 
be available if it has been already taken by some other plugin or defined by 
user. You can bind it to another key or key combination with Vim's |:map| 
commands. For example, you could put these lines to your ~/.vimrc file: >

        nmap <F7> <Plug>VimchantSpellCheckSwitch
        imap <F7> <C-O><Plug>VimchantSpellCheckSwitch

This would make <F7> as the switch key in normal and insert mode. Notice that 
in insert mode mappings you need to precede the right-hand side with <C-O>.

Spell-checker's state, whether it's on or off, is preserved buffer-wise until 
the buffer is removed from Vim's buffer list. Only the text in currently 
active window is actually checked for spelling, though. When the spell-checker 
is turned on the check is run once every time user stops moving the cursor and 
editing text. The interval period is defined by 'updatetime' option. It's 4000 
milliseconds (= 4 seconds) by default but you might want to reduce the value 
so that the spell-checker responds faster. For example, you could add the 
following line to your ~/.vimrc file: >

        set updatetime=1000

That's pretty much it. Happy typing!
